# Line of Effort

## LOE 1: Establishing a long-term, accessible repository for project artifacts

**Task 1:** Per the PGB discussion, Dee and Mark are resolving the repository issue for OCA in general and will provide us all guidance.

**Task 2:** Forrest will share said guidance with Ian and Ian will make sure all our documentation is properly organized

**Task 3:** Ian will provide guidance to the rest of the team on how to access the information and rules for collaboration/updating artifacts.

**Task 4:** Duncan will keep us all focused on this.

## LOE 2
Use case codification. Ontologies are most useful and easier to understand once a specific example is codified using the model.  This means depicting actual data from a real-world or “exercise” use-case.  We will use the previously constructed use case from the architecture working group and add sufficient data level fidelity so that a knowledge graph (the ontology linked to instance data) can be formed to represent the use case. We will model two components of that use case only so as to avoid boiling the ocean.  The two components are; a) the actions of the cyber threat actor and b) the actions of the SIEM.

**Task 1:** Ian and Forrest will tear apart the use case some more identifying any additional details needed for effective the threat and SIEM modeling using the ontology. Forrest will pass details to Ryan for his work.

**Task 2:** Ian and Forrest will take a stab at modeling the SIEM functions but we need to have another meeting to discuss those to get the OCA position as to whether we hit the sweet spot.  Meeting will be OCA internal only (explained below).

**Task 3:** Ryan and the TAC team will work on the cyber threat actor in the use case. Ryan can invite whoever in OCA that he wants to participate in the effort.  I will leave that to him.

**Task 4:** We will link the two efforts in Task 2 and 3.  Since both will be based on BFO but conducted independently, this will give us some idea on interoperability within OCA efforts.

**Task 5:** Forrest will package up the details on the use case and provide to the UCO team (DC3 lead) to model the same use case with UCO and CASE.  Will wait until we have a draft of the OCA work done so that we will have sufficient details to share and be able to do an apples to apples comparison. 

**Task 6:** DC3 team will lead an independent effort to model the same use case using the UCO and CASE.

**Task 7:** Conduct a full meeting of the coalition of the willing to compare the two models and identify opportunities for alignment/rationalization.

## LOE 3
PACE, KESTREL, OpenC2 linkage.  Once we have sufficient details in the Use Case, we can show the benefits of linking the ontology to the data fields in the messages for based on each of these models.  Way ahead will be discussed with those project leads once we have the use case modeled out and can present it to them for consideration.
